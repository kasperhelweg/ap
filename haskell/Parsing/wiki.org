* Code snippets
  This snippet build a tree as my original solution to the defs problem.
  
#+NAME: Haskell strange recursion
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
defs = do d  <- def
          ds <- defs
          let Def id curve ds' = d in
           return $ Def id curve ds:ds'
      <|> return []
                       
def = do id <- ident; schar '='; curve <- curve;
         return $ Def id curve []
